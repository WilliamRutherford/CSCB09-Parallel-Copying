When you create a new hard link instead of duplicating files, it is different from a soft link as all hard links directly link the same inode, while soft links to another file in the system. That being said, problems are presented while detecting hard links as since they are the same inode as the original. Every process scans one directory for such inode, they do not have information on other directories when using fork, making it extremely difficult to tell whether the file is a hard link or the original file.
